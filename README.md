Currently pursuing my Masters of Science in Cyber Security at the University of Tampa. 

I have developed multiple skills in the area of cyber security. This encompasses IT Governance, SecDevOps, BC/DR, AWS cloud security, risk analysis, vulnerability mapping, SCM, project management, security frameworks and more.

My goals is to make a direct impact on a company utilizing my professional skills attained through college coursework and projects.

My degree is a cross between MIS(Management Information Systems) and the IT realm. My skills include Information System Management, Database Development, Networking, Web Page Administration, GIS, Networking Administration, Programming, Information Security and more.

 I've gained a strong understanding of data models, normalization, database design, SQL, QBE queries, forms, and reports through multiple projects.

On the MIS side, I've gained an abundant amount of experience in the area of Networking This includes routers, switches, subnetting, VMs, VLANs, VPN, SSH, IPS, IDS, firewalls, packet sniffing, routing protocols, frames, packets, topologies wiring, racks, DNS, servers and the OSI/TCP model. 

 I worked on web administration through multiple projects in class and out, utilizing HTML5, CSS for Web Design, and UX/UI. Also doing work in Watson Analytics, Predictive Analytics-RStudio(R), and GIS(Geographic Information Sytems) using ArcGIS has given me the ability to be an analytical thinker.

The IT portion of my degree has trained me in a technical background including installation, configuration, backup/recovery, and baselining multiple Windows Operating Systems. I've become proficient in Microsoft Office Suite applications, Virtual Machines, Programming (Java, C++), Visual Studio, NetBeans, and a plethora of other skills. 

With my dedication and the right company's vision, I believe I can make a great contribution to the overall success of the organization.
